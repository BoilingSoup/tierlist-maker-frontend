# Features

  - Export tier lists as .png and download
  - View, modify (does not persist), and download tier lists shared by other people
  ### These features require auth
  - Save/Edit/Delete your tier list to the cloud

# Why did I make this?
  - Learn how to make drag & drop UIs
  - Get more practice making full-stack apps
  - Practice implementing file uploads
  - Improve my approaches for server-side & client-side caching
  - All the tier list makers on Google's first result page are too confusing for me
